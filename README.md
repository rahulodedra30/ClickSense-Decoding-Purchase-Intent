# Title: 
ClickSense-Decoding-Purchase-Intent

# Description:
ClickSense project aims to decode online shoppers' purchase intentions by analyzing their interactions on an e-commerce platform. Leveraging machine learning techniques, the project explores various factors influencing purchasing behavior.

# Objectives:
1. Understand the key factors driving online shoppers' purchase decisions.
2. Develop predictive models to forecast purchasing intentions accurately.
3. Assess the impact of different variables such as pageviews, session duration, and special days on purchase likelihood.
4. Provide insights to optimize the online shopping experience and increase conversion rates.

# Data Source:
The dataset utilized in this project is the "Online Shoppers Purchasing Intention Dataset" sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It comprises 10 numeric and 8 categorical variables, capturing user behavior and session characteristics.

# Methodology:
1. Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and balancing data using SMOTE.
2. Feature Engineering: Extracting relevant features from the dataset to enhance model performance.
3. Model Training: Implementing logistic regression, k-nearest neighbors, decision tree, support vector machine, and neural network algorithms.
4. Model Evaluation: Assessing model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
5. Interpretation: Analyzing feature importance and understanding the influence of variables on purchase intentions.

# Key Findings:
1. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) model outperformed other algorithms, achieving 93% accuracy in predicting purchase intentions.
2. Features such as pageviews, session duration, and proximity to special days significantly influence purchasing behavior.
3. SMOTE technique effectively balanced the dataset, improving the performance of classification models.
4. Neural networks demonstrated promising results, indicating the potential of deep learning approaches in understanding complex user behavior patterns.

# Limitations and Future Work:
1. Limited to the scope of variables available in the dataset; additional features could enhance model accuracy.
2. Future work could involve real-time data analysis and incorporating external factors such as economic indicators and marketing campaigns.
3. Exploration of advanced machine learning techniques like ensemble methods and deep learning for further improving predictive accuracy.
4. Addressing potential biases in the dataset and refining models to adapt to evolving consumer trends.

# Conclusion:
The ClickSense project successfully decoded online shoppers' purchase intentions by leveraging machine learning techniques and analyzing a diverse set of variables. By understanding the underlying factors driving purchasing behavior, businesses can optimize their strategies to enhance user experience and drive sales growth in the e-commerce domain.
