# Title: 
## ClickSense: Decoding Purchase Intent

# Description:
This project aims to decode customers' purchase intents on an online shopping platform, utilizing advanced analytics techniques on user behavior data. Through comprehensive analysis and modeling, it seeks to understand the factors influencing purchasing decisions and predict customers' propensity to make a purchase. Leveraging machine learning techniques, the project explores various factors influencing purchasing behavior.

# Objectives:
1. Analyze user behavior data to uncover patterns and insights related to purchasing intentions.
2. Develop predictive models to forecast customers' likelihood of making a purchase.
3. Evaluate the performance of various classification algorithms in predicting purchase intents.
4. Utilize techniques such as Log-transforming Skewed Variables, Principal Component Analysis, and SMOTE to preprocess data and enhance model accuracy.

# Data Source:
The dataset utilized in this project is the "Online Shoppers Purchasing Intention Dataset" sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It comprises 10 numeric and 8 categorical variables, capturing user behavior and session characteristics.

# Methodology:
1. Preprocessing: Handle skewness in the data to ensure a more symmetrical distribution and improve model performance.
2. Dimensionality Reduction: Apply Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset while preserving as much variance as possible.
3. Data Balancing: Utilize Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) to balance the dataset, especially useful when dealing with imbalanced classes.
4. Model Building: Implement diverse classification algorithms including Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Neural Networks.
5. Evaluation Metrics: Evaluate model performance using key metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

# Key Findings:
1. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) model outperformed other algorithms, achieving 93% accuracy in predicting purchase intentions.
2. Features such as pageviews, session duration, and proximity to special days significantly influence purchasing behavior.
3. SMOTE technique effectively balanced the dataset, improving the performance of classification models.
4. Neural networks demonstrated promising results, indicating the potential of deep learning approaches in understanding complex user behavior patterns.

# Limitations and Future Work:
1. Limited to the scope of variables available in the dataset; additional features could enhance model accuracy.
2. Future work could involve real-time data analysis and incorporating external factors such as economic indicators and marketing campaigns.
3. Exploration of advanced machine learning techniques like ensemble methods and deep learning for further improving predictive accuracy.

# Conclusion:
The ClickSense project successfully decoded online shoppers' purchase intentions by leveraging machine learning techniques and analyzing a diverse set of variables. By understanding the underlying factors driving purchasing behavior, businesses can optimize their strategies to enhance user experience and drive sales growth in the e-commerce domain.
